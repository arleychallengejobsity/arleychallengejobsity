# Challenge Architecture
Since IÂ´m an Azure Data Engineer, I used the following Azure resources in order to develop the challenge:

- Azure Storage Account (Data Lake) -> Used to store "trips.csv" file
- Azure Data factory -> Used to orchestrate the pipeline execution 
- Azure Databricks -> Scalable Spark solution used for writting PySpark code (calculate points distance)
- Azure SQL Server -> Scalable solution used to store the final data (as requested)

## Logging in Azure:
- For the challenge purpose IÂ´ve created a Free Azure Subscription that Jobsity can use for testing and validating the challenge:
- Login: arleychallengejobsity@outlook.com
- Password: challenge123*


## Resources Creation and configuration:
- Azure Storage Account (Data Lake): IÂ´ve create a storage account resource named **"challengejobsity"** and a blob container named **"trips"**. Inside trips container I created a folder named **"RAW"** and inside RAW folder uploaded the **_"trips.csv"_** file as you seen in bellow image:
