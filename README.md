# Challenge Architecture
Since IÂ´m an Azure Data Engineer, I used the following Azure resources in order to develop the challenge:

- Azure Storage Account (Data Lake) -> Used to store "trips.csv" file
- Azure Data factory -> Used to orchestrate the pipeline execution 
- Azure Databricks -> Scalable Spark solution used for writting PySpark code (calculate points distance)
- Azure SQL Server -> Scalable solution used to store the final data (as requested)



## Logging in Azure:
- For challenging purpoce IÂ´ve created a Free Azure Subscription that Jobsity can use for testing and validating the challenge 
- Login: arleychallengejobsity@outlook.com
